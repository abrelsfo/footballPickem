# Football Pickem
> An app to help organize college football seasons and friendly wagers

Keep track of the current season, next game, home games, away games, times, and best of all see who can guess the best between you and your friends. This is a work in progress that will not have network ability.
This is to be used in an office setting where you can create a shared folder to keep track of scores, but feel free to fork this and add network capabilities if you so desire. If you really want you can send me PR
with network capabilities.

This can be set up with other sports fairly easily as well. You can get division and team information from [sportsJSON](https://github.com/abrelsfo/sportsJSON) but it currently only has college football.
